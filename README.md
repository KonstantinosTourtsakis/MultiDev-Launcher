## Description
MultiDev-Launcher is a simple software launcher aiming to support
several devices for software launching and system navigation in
Windows operating systems. Users can add or remove directories in
which their applications are located (ideally their application
shortcuts) and launch them through their preferred device. The
application currently supports keyboard, mouse and gamepads.

## Installation
- Download and run the [application launcher](https://github.com/KonstantinosTourtsakis/MultiDev-Launcher/releases/tag/v1.0.0)
- Proceed with the setup and read the ReadMe file
- Run MultiDev-Launcher
- Enter a user name and then go to Settings and add directories to your application

## How to use it
Right after installing the application you will be greeted with a
welcome message during the first execution. Then you will be asked
to type your user name before accessing the main window. Once
you enter the main application window you can add the directories
in which your applications are located. You can do that through the
“Add Directory” button in “Settings” tab. The application will scan
the directory recursively for any executable files or application
shortcuts and add them to the known applications list.


## Troubleshooting

If you’re experiencing any problems with the application then make
sure to report them to the application’s repository. You can open an
issue [here](https://github.com/KonstantinosTourtsakis/MultiDev-Launcher/issues).
